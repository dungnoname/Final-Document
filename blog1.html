                Good evening Mrs. Chau, my name's Do Nguyen Nguyen. Today, I would like to talk about my fitness and eating habits.
                
                Firstly, I believe that I'm in good shape because I'm confident about myself, in my opinion it's not just about looking good, I priority about feeling strong and happy. I'm not a couch potato, simply because I feel that not good for my health. I love activities like running, playing badminton, swimming,.. and regularly exercising them is also my secret to staying in shape. Don't forget to get enough sleep, about 7-8 hours each night, which is definitely important for my overall health and fitness.
                
                Besides staying active, I also pay attention to my diet so I can become healthier. I try to eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains every day  and most importantly is don't skip meals to staying in shape. I avoid sugary drinks and junk food as much as possible cause it makes me get acne.., and I also drinking lots of water hope that one day I can glow up with a beautiful skin (so I can be a beautiful girlüò≠). Limiting fast food is essential because it's high in unhealthy fats and calories (and it makes our skin wrose..) I'm obsessed with acne‚ò∫Ô∏è
                
                In conclusion, staying healthy and eating well are essential for a life.By getting used to good habits, we can improve our physical and mental health and live happily and be a beautiful girlü§©.
