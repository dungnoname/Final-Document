                Topic 3: Talk about your personal dress code
                
                Greetings Mrs. Chau, my name's  Do Nguyen Nguyen, and I'm 17 years old, currently studying at FPT Polytechnic. Today, I'd like to share my personal dress code. 
                
                I always make sure to stay updated on fashion trends. I have a spot, for the Light Academia Style that resonates with my own style preferences. Comfort is essential to me so I opt wearing soft and cozy clothes, particularly in colors like brown or beige which happen to be my go to colors. For today I went to school with a laid back look, a Harry Potter themed tee matched with jeans. A choice, for both work and study.
                
                When it comes to choosing outfits, for occasions I prefer to opt for respectful attire. For school I believe it's important to wear clothing that allows for easy movement and focus like simple t shirts and long pants. When heading to the movies I think dressing casually is fine. Its crucial not to sport anything revealing or attention grabbing. As for weddings I consider it necessary to dress in a manner, my recommendation would be dresses or a classy vest to show reverence for the occasion and the hosts. 
                
                There are clothing choices I steer clear of in settings. For example shorts or flip flops are not appropriate for school as they might come off as disrespectful. Likewise overly casual or unkempt attire isn't suitable, for weddings unless explicitly stated otherwise. Personally I never wearing backless or strapless tops because they make me feel uneasy despite liking their appearance.
                
                Dressing formally make me a sense of maturity and responsibility, while casual clothes helps me exude relaxation and approachability.
                
                I usually keep an eye out for sales, on websites such as Shopee, TikTok.. to snag some deals on clothing. While I mostly shop online to find the good prices, for myself I also enjoy visiting stores to try on clothes before making a purchase.
                
                At my school, we're encouraged to dress smartly and we only wear a uniform polo shirt on Mondays.  The uniform consists of an orange polo shirt featuring the schools emblem "FPT Polytechnic College" stitched on it. It's feels comfortable when wearing and easy to coordinate with other clothes.
                
                In Vietnam primary school pupils can don shorts. In secondary and high school shorts are typically prohibited.
                
                In conclusion, my personal dress code leans towards casual and comfortable clothes because I want to appear active and approachable. However, I understand the importance of dressing appropriately for different occasions, whether it's for school, going to the movies, or attending a wedding. Thank you for listening.</p>
