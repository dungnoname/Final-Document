                Greetings, Ms. Chau, my name's Do Nguyen Nguyen. Today, I would like to talk about my shopping habits.
                First, I am not a shopaholic because I always ensure that I only purchase items that I require and I do so tactfully. Yes, mostly I do budget my money as I think every single penny spent should be valuable. For instance, I make the list of food items required in a month and then I have to adhere to the said list rather than going for the random purchase.
                Clothes I normally purchase at Vincom Plaza. They have number of brands and they have different accesorries in different styles which I like. They also conduct promotional offers which I love mostly their winter sale as I can purchase clothes of my choice for cheaper prices. I once remember buying a fiery, winter coat that was half the price I initially thought it was and that has been one of my prized wears. For electronics, I often purchase at the Thể Giới Di Động because this store has good service and its products' quality is satisfactory. I made a purchase there a few months ago and obtained a new laptop, the sellers were very informative, they guided me to the most appropriate model of the laptop.
                I occasionally make orders online, probably once in a month. Sometimes I visit different site and try to find the best offer on this or that thing. They're ideal for what is often a time-consuming process of searching for the exact item that you want at the lowest possible price. Recently, in the last month I wore a whole evening assessing the Smartphone of my choice from various types and brands in line with my pocket and requirements.
                I do purchase clothes, shoes, and sometimes even electronics through the internet they are sold on. For instance I purchased sneakers and a smartphone the previous month.
                They were cheap I bought the sneakers on sale at 30% off the original price. The smartphone had an awesome performance and indeed the reviews were right I'm glade I bought it.
                My favorite website for online shopping is Shopee because it has a wide range of products and offers great discounts. I also like how they often have special promotions and free shipping deals. The best website for online shopping is also Lazada because it has a good return policy and fast delivery. I once bought a kitchen appliance from Lazada, and it arrived in perfect condition within two days.
                I usually consider price and customer reviews because they help me make informed decisions. I want to make sure I am getting a good deal and that other customers are satisfied with the product. I also look at the product's rating and the number of reviews.
                Products with high ratings and many reviews are usually more reliable.
                I transact through my credit cards instead of cash because is easier and I am rewarded with points. These point can be later on exchanged to receive an offer or a discount on the next purchase. Furthermore, the use of a credit card is usually more secure and the buyer is safeguarded by more options and protection provisions.
                I had a bad experience once I was congratulated by my team for a promotion in the organization that never happened. I had bossed for a dress in a certain online store, then I received it only to realize that it was of the wrong size and color. I called customer support, and they were quite nice. They permitted me to return the dress and gain my money back. Ever since then I take my time to ensure that I check the size charts and also ensure that I read more on the return policy. There are no bad stores that I have experienced because of this; as usual I scrutinise the product before purchasing it.
                However, I also do not prefer to purchase from a sale off items because most of the time they are out of fashion, or they are usually damaged goods. But, of course, this is in a given frequency because I let myself to go to a certain store to buy something that I overwhelmingly wanted and that item is cheaper than I expected. For example, I once purchase designer handbag set on sale and it has become my favorite accessories.
                As for me, I rarely haggle because I am not very good at it, and I'm rather shy to set forward an offer to the sellers. However, I respect people with prowess in haggling in order to get the best deal on everything. At times I request my peers who I go out with for shopping to assist me in haggling at the markets.
                That's all about my shopping habits, thank you for your listening.</p>
